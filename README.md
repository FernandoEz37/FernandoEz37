## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hey! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a interest in **pentesting and Red Team activities**. I love diving into systems to understand how they work‚Äîand how to break them (ethically, of course).

I'm naturally **curious**, always looking to **improve** and learn new tools or techniques. I enjoy solving technical challenges, working on labs, and keeping up with the fast-paced world of cybersecurity.

Outside of hacking and tech, I‚Äôm into **music**, **video games**üïπÔ∏è and **anime** üéßüéÆüéå.

> üöÄ Always learning. Always building.  
> üéØ Looking for opportunities to grow in offensive security or hybrid security teams.
